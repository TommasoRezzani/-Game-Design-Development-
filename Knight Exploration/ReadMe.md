# 🏰 Knight Exploration

My very first game development project! This 2D platformer represents my initial journey into game design and development, marking the beginning of my learning adventure in the world of interactive entertainment.

## 🎮 About the Project

**Knight Exploration** is a 2D platformer game built with Godot Engine using GDScript. As my first project in game development, it showcases fundamental game mechanics and serves as a learning foundation for more complex projects to come.

## 🚀 What I've Learned

This project introduced me to:
- **Basic 2D Game Development** - Player movement, collision detection, scene management
- **Godot Engine Fundamentals** - Node system, signals, and scene architecture  
- **GDScript Programming** - Variables, functions, and game logic implementation
- **Game Design Principles** - Level design, player experience, and gameplay flow
- **Asset Management** - Sprites, animations, and resource organization

## 🎯 Features

- **Player Movement** - Smooth character controls and physics
- **Platforming Mechanics** - Jump mechanics and collision systems
- **Level Design** - Crafted environments for exploration
- **Animation System** - Character animations and visual feedback
- **Game States** - Menu systems and game flow management

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Engine:** Godot 4.x
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Genre:** 2D Platformer
- **Status:** Complete Learning Project but still upgrading with new features before releasing

## 📚 Learning Resources

This project was initially inspired by and built following this tutorial:
**[Godot Tutorial Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0)**

*Note: The tutorial served as an introductory foundation, but I expanded significantly beyond the original scope, adding my own features, mechanics, and design elements to create a more comprehensive learning experience.*

## 🎨 Assets & Credits

- **Tutorial Base:** Following the introductory concepts from the linked YouTube tutorial
- **Additional Development:** Extended features and mechanics implemented independently

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Download Godot Engine** (4.x or compatible version)
2. **Clone or download** this repository
3. **Open the project** in Godot by selecting the `project.godot` file
4. **Press F5** or click the play button to run the game

## 🔄 Project Evolution

As my first project, **Knight Exploration** represents:
- **Learning Foundation** - Core concepts that enabled future projects
- **Experimentation Platform** - Testing ground for various mechanics
- **Milestone Achievement** - Proof of concept for my game development journey

## 🎯 Future Improvements

Enhancements I'm going to add:
- [ ] Additional levels and environments
- [ ] Enhanced combat system
- [ ] Power-ups and collectibles
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] More polished UI/UX elements
